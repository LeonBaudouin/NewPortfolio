Vincent Le Vern took care of the design of the site and Michael de Laborde and myself, working as apprentices at Belle Epoque, took care of the development."

      "text": "I had a great time creating 3D abstract shapes and making up textures. I also had fun setting up the small <b>UI and 3D interactions</b> that makes the navigation of the website fun."

      "title": "Tech",
      "text": "As for all projects made by Belle Epoque, we used NextJS and we added React Three Fiber to manage <b>ThreeJS</b>. We also used <b>Framer Motion</b> to handle animations. In addition to being an animation lib, Framer Motion makes <b>high frequency reactivity</b> easier which is difficult to manage in a React application. This stack was really nice to use, even though React Three Fiber often leads to overly verbose code."
